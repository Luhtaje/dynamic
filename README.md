# Ring Buffer Library

This project is an engineering thesis project conducted for Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in collaboration with Rightware Oy.

The primary focus of the project is a C++ templated dynamic ring buffer class library. This library implements both First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) capabilities. Importantly, it follows the standard requirements of both a container and sequence container. This design ensures compatibility with the standard container adapters like stack, queue, and priority queue. A unique feature of this buffer is its FIFO and LIFO capabilities along with dynamic memory allocation feature: when full, it automatically allocates more memory instead of overwriting existing elements.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `docs/`: This directory contains documentation generated by Doxygen. You can find both HTML and Latex formats.
  - `html/`
  - `latex/`

- `googletest/`: This directory contains the GoogleTest framework files. Note that GoogleTest is included as a GitHub submodule.

- `src/`: This directory houses all the source files for the ring buffer library.

- `test/`: This directory contains the test files for the ring buffer library.

## Building and Testing

The project is configured to create a GoogleTest executable that tests the functionality of the buffer and its iterators. The project can be built using VScode IDE or Cmake build system.

## Documentation

Doxygen is used to generate project documentation. You can find the output in the `docs/` directory, in both HTML and Latex formats.
